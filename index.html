    <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
    <h2>Thank you for coming!</h2>
    <p>My name is Ramith Rajan and I am currently a student at BCIT! I <em>love</em> the classes that I am currently taking. The one thing I would like to see more of here is some cheaper coffee stores. There is a Tim Horton's on the same block as the school but the people there are <strong>super scary</strong>.</p>
    <p>The courses that I am taking are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/outlines/20223048470/">Math 1310</a></li>
        <li>Comm 1116</li>
        <li>ACIT 1620</li>
        <li>ORGB 1100</li>
        <li>ACIT 1515</li>
        <li>ACIT 1630</li>
        <li>ACIT 1420</li>

        
    </ul>
