        My name is Ramith Rajan and I am currently a student at BCIT! I
        <em>love</em> the classes that I am currently taking. The one thing I
        would like to see more of here is some cheaper coffee stores. There is a
        Tim Horton's on the same block as the school but the people there are
        <strong>super scary</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>The courses that I am taking are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/outlines/20223048470/">Math 1310</a>
        </li>
        <li>Comm 1116</li>
        <li>ACIT 1620</li>
        <li>ORGB 1100</li>
        <li>ACIT 1515</li>
        <li>ACIT 1630</li>
        <li>ACIT 1420</li>
