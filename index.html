        My name is Ramith Rajan and I am currently a student at BCIT! I
        <em>love</em> the classes that I am currently taking. The one thing I
        would like to see more of here is some cheaper coffee stores. There is a
        Tim Horton's on the same block as the school but the people there are
        <strong>super scary</strong>.
